    "## Goal\n",
    "For my second solution i wanted to use a method that would perform like a flappy bird playing ubermensch!<br>\n",
    "My reasoning is that the power of Neural networks would be perfect as it is better equipped to handle continuous problems that can handle randomization aswell.<br>\n",
    "Whilst Q-learning performed admirably it could not advance from the level of pretty good without having much more finer details about the game progression added to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment (Same text as in solution 1)\n",
    "Open-AI has developed two flappy bird games for python gymnasium. The main one is a game that returns to the pictures to the state. The simplified one, the one i am using, returns some basic values:\n",
    "##### Distance to the next pipe\n",
    "##### The different in height between the bird and the middle of the pipe gap\n",
    "##### Reward\n",
    "##### Failure\n",
    "This in practice means that any trained model will be using a continous stream of three variables.\n",
    "##### Possible actions: To flap or not to flap (1 or 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Result\n",
    "It was a time consuming task to troubleshoot and get working, the rewards system especially was having some issues along with the usage of the networks output. But once it got the chance to learn it learned QUICKLY. I am amazed at the speed it completely solved how to play flappy birds."
